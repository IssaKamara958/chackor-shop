## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Golden Brown (#9A6F32), evoking the color of Achakourou Caf√© Touba coffee beans and Senegalese warmth.
- Background color: Very light golden brown (#F2E8D5), offering a neutral, clean canvas that does not distract from the products.
- Accent color: Dark Brown (#3D2B1F), used for important actionable items. Provides a strong contrast to the primary color.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to give a touch of warmth and personality for clear readability in both headlines and body text.
- Use consistent, clear icons from 'react-icons' (e.g., FaHome, FaShoppingCart) to enhance navigation and functionality, complementing the clean design.
- Employ a responsive, mobile-first layout using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (iOS, Android, tablets, desktops).
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as hover effects on product cards and transitions in forms, to enhance user engagement and provide a polished feel.
